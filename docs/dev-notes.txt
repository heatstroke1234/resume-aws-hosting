Why AWS?
- AWS Resume Challenge, outlined certification and how to host the site
- interested in the cloud, this gave me an excuse to really get into it
How did you make the acc?
- Parents had an inactive acc that I just took over
How to log in?
- IAM user setup (setup as admin)
- CLI and Terraform afterward
- Needed a way to log in to AWS w/o static credentials
    - access key and secret key are not secure b/c they are permanent and anyone who accesses your computer can easily steal it and use it to access your acc
- AWS SSO was needed, enable Identity Center for the acc, which creates the startup url
- Created SSO user by providing email
- Now can set up SSO user just by using command line (assuming aws cli is installed locally)
- “aws sso login” command will do the job
Why CLI + terraform?
- everything is saved in code, can be recreated easily (reproducable)
- Route 53
    - bought domain name for abt $15
    - AWS automatically created hosted zone plus two “sample” records that didn’t serve my purposes
    - first configured IPV4 and IPV6 connections
        - Configured A (IPV4) and AAAA (IPV6) records, w/ alias routing traffic to my CloudFront distribution
    - configured this, but still got a 403 error (configured cloudfront to be https only)
        - googled, and realized I needed an certificate for my website specifically
        - configured in CloudFront, set alternate domain name to my website name
        - this setting required certificate, so went to ACM to get certificate
        - attached certificate to setting, and applied settings
        - stuck in “pending validation”, so needed to create DNS record to validate certificate
            - AWS requires certificate validation b/c they are a certificate authority themselves
        - option in ACM to automatically create, so I clicked it, and it happpened
        - tried website, and it worked
